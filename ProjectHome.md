Welcome to the Avisynth Video Restoration project.  This site hosts the source code to a number of Avisynth Scripts and Plugins which mainly focus on Video Restoration, Calibration, and Utilities.  It was started by the orginal contributing author.  Programmers:  Please feel free to improve or branch the projects here!  Video Enthusiasts:  Restore your old analog recordings to the best quality!  Free tools and documentation!

Some results and scripts below:

Note: there seems to be the most interest in the software TBC.  I'm afraid the script is experimental at the moment, however it does have potential - and is a different approach than jitter plugins or any others I've found.  I don't expect this project to be updated before Jan/09.  Please discuss at http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=69

Thank you.

Update:  The description above is forward-looking, but there is little content here.  It hasn't been updated in three years; however I have been developing during that time.  The doom9 forums is a better place to find recent developments.
