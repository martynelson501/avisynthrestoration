= Introduction =

TBC is an Avisynth Script which stabilizes timing jitter in video from analog VCRs, similiar in function to a TimeBaseCorrector.


= Details =

After processing your analog video through this filter, it is stabilized in the horizontal direction.  A reality of a normally working mechanical device is the imprecisness of it's timing.  Due to the varying speeds of the video head in a VCR, variations in timing are created.  This results in the symptom of video lines jumping left and right.  This script detects the end of each line, and places it in a known spot, thus preventing the jumping.
It is important to stabilize video so that further processing can perform optimally.  For example, scripts which rely on motion vectors will be confused by the constant jumping.
