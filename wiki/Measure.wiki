= Introduction =

Measure is an Avisynth Script which generates greybars, and can measure such a testpattern by displaying luminence values on top of each bar.  The resulting video can be used for testing the video response of analog systems.

The resulting video can be used for testing the video response of analog systems.
This can then be used to calibrate capture brightness/contrast.

It requires [http://www.avisynth.org avisynth] to run.  Once Avisynth is installed, open the included .avs file in Mediaplayer.  A default testpattern should be displayed.  To use on your own videos, modify the .avs as a text file and follow the included instructions to use your own video.

Above is a measurement of the testpattern after being recorded on a VHS VCR.  Notice the noise and brightness/contrast differences; contrast is too high and brightness is too low, cutting off the Y=32 bar.
