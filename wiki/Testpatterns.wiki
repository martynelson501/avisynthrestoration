= Introduction =

Testpatterns is an Avisynth Script which generates sinewaves in the Y channel directly in YV12.


= Details =

The resulting video can be used for testing the video response of analog systems.
The included functions are also useful to plotting other functions, and demonstrate the implementation of recursive functions.

The above shows the generated testpattern of 8 sinewaves in 720 pixels, which is 53.3uS of video.

The above video shows the testpattern after recording to a VHS VCR.  The contrast at this frequency is pretty good.

The above video shows the testpattern after recording to a VHS VCR.  The contrast at this frequency is very poor.  The 135 sinewaves represent a real video frequency of 2.53MHz.  This video can theoretically be restored by application of a Fourier Transform to restore the frequency response.
